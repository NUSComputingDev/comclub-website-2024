To achieve this, I am committed to actively resolving conflict and supporting MC members when they face roadblocks. 
          
          Having served as Finance Secretary, I had the opportunity to participate in Presidential Wing meetings. This experience gave me valuable insights into the challenges of planning and executing the various Computing Club events. With this knowledge, I will guide the new committee to avoid past pitfalls and improve the overall quality of our events.
          
          With your support, we can bring Computing Club to new heights and make SoC a better place for all students!

My journey with Comp Club began with my amazing experience at FOW’24, which inspired me to join the 27th MC as its Sponsorship Director. Over the past year, I’ve worked hard to give back to the SOC community that felt like home since day 1. As the ex-sponsorship director, I’m well versed in external stakeholder management and I aspire to apply those skills internally, as the General Secretary. I was involved internally too, including staying late into the night for Exam Welfare Packing, as a House Head of FOW’25 and many more events.  If elected, I am committed to ensuring Comp Club’s smooth administrative function, using my extensive experience to guide the next MC. Together, we can create a Comp Club that truly serves YOU, the people, the essence, the life of SOC.

          Hello everyone, I am Niles Loh, a year 1 Computer Engineering Major. Midway through Computing Rag 2025, I had thoughts of running to be the next Project Director. Rag was a unique experience; it was nothing like the previous orientations I had organized or participated in. 
          
          When it was announced that we had won the bronze award, I remember the stinging frustration that hit me. I remember the tears of my peers standing beside me. We were proud of our performance, but the bronze award label just felt wrong. 
          
          After spending nights analyzing past years’ gold award Rags and thinking of how Computing could have done better, I made up my mind to run for the position of Director of Rag.
          
          If elected, I will bring a clear vision, strategic planning, and relentless execution to this project. To win gold, we must Plan Well, Execute Better, and Win Big.

I hope to carry forward this impact that Computing Club has to not just the upcoming freshies but also to the current student population together as a team. My goal is to build a sense of community through sports events planned out for you. Regardless if you are staying in halls, an introvert or an extrovert, I believe that there’s always something fun to try out and I hope to see y’all around!

          Hello, I’m Ma Mingyang, running for Academic Liaison. Low-latency bridge. Clear answers. I see this role as router in SoC’s network—connecting students, faculty, and resources with minimal hops, no jargon. My style is humble and curious: I listen first, ask when I don’t know, translate concerns clearly, and close the loop so questions don’t disappear. Rather than add new events, I’ll focus on what already works—seniors, TAs, advisors, official channels—so you get answers without another session. Think of me as bandwidth-efficient: when you ping, I route; when an answer lands, I acknowledge; when something’s unclear, I follow up until it’s usable. As an international student, I’m comfortable bridging contexts while centering core SoC priorities. No sweeping promises—just steady, transparent communication and the unglamorous coordination that keeps things moving. If that sounds like the kind of bridge you want this year, I’d be honoured to serve.

        <p>
          All things nice and everything spice starts here. If I'm elected, I will: 
            • Take initiative to secure relevant sponsorships for the committee's events for the club so as to elevate the experience of members who will be participating in the aforementioned events. 
            • Create even more cool and relatable merchandise designs and types like cute Soccat goods, SoC-relatable laptop stickers or stylish apparel, keeping in mind your thoughts and opinions. I'll take into consideration the ideas members of the club — fellow students of SoC — have, and ensure well-designed merch reaches you, so you can wear and use them with pride as a club member. 
            
          My experience with merch creation as a designer, as well as with leadership and event planning in my previous post as part of the Executive Committee for my club, will help me bring these to life for you.
