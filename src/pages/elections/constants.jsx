          Hello everyone, I’m Choong Jing Xiang, a first-year Computer Science
          student here at the School of Computing. Before starting university, I
          was excited about all the new learning opportunities and unique
          experiences NUS offers, but at the same time, I felt apprehensive as
          this was so different from everything that I know and I believe many
          of you share the same sentiments. However, through the Freshmen
          Orientation Programs and Rag and Flag, I felt an incredible sense of
          welcome and belonging within the SoC family which helped me better
          transition into university life. If I were to be elected as the
          Director of Rag and Flag, my goal is to give back to the school and
          the student body as well as provide this unique experience to the next
          batch of freshmen to help make them feel at home. And of course,

          which has shaped my university life positively. Having been actively
          involved in organizing one of the Computing Orientation camps this
          year, I have gained valuable insights into event management and
          student engagement. Leveraging on this significant experience, I am
          committed to creating a vibrant and supportive environment, where
          every student can connect, thrive and create lasting memories in SoC.
          My dedication to serving the student population, coupled with my
          experience and understanding of student needs, equips meto better
          enhance the student life and experience in SoC. Together with the
          Management Committee members, I hope to build an SoC that is more than
          just an academic hub, but also an inclusive and welcoming community
          where every student feels at home.

        <p>
          I am running for the role of Welfare IC in the Computing Club since I
          am extremely passionate about creating a well bonded computing family.
          Given the endless assignments and heavy workload, students sometimes
          do not feel valued and heard. Therefore, I aim to create an open
          communication channel whereby everyone can share their opinions on
          what could aid in the betterment of their life so that I can do my
          best in making it happen. Furthermore, I am also committed to
          embedding welfare with events which encourage social connection while
          advocating for a respectful and inclusive culture. Together, we can
          ensure that everyone not only excels academically but also feels
          supported and empowered during this journey. You guys can help me turn
          this vision into reality, ensuring that this isn’t just a place for us
          to learn but also to thrive.
