        <h1>Who are we?</h1>
        <p>
          Established when the NUS School of Computing (SoC) gained
          independence as a separate faculty in 1998, the NUS Students&#39;
          Computing Club is the official faculty club and sole union
          representative of all undergraduates in SoC.
        </p>
        <p>
          The club has since been taking care of the student life in SoC by
          organising various events and activities to promote campus vibrancy.
          We safeguard the interest of our undergraduates, ensure their voices
          are heard, provide welfare, and form the bridge between our students
          and the school.
